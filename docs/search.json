    "section": "Against the Grain",
    "text": "Against the Grain\nChapters 1-4 being covered on June 4th.\n\nWhy did humans abandon hunting and gathering for sedentary communities dependent on livestock and cereal grains, and governed by precursors of today’s states? Most people believe that plant and animal domestication allowed humans, finally, to settle down and form agricultural villages, towns, and states, which made possible civilization, law, public order, and a presumably secure way of living. But archaeological and historical evidence challenges this narrative. The first agrarian states, says James C. Scott, were born of accumulations of domestications: first fire, then plants, livestock, subjects of the state, captives, and finally women in the patriarchal family—all of which can be viewed as a way of gaining control over reproduction.\nScott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture, the advantages of mobile subsistence, the unforeseeable disease epidemics arising from crowding plants, animals, and grain, and why all early states are based on millets and cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the “barbarians” who long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension between states and nonsubject peoples."

A new profession of insolvency professionals has come to exist owing to the law. There are several questions about bankruptcy reform in the mind of researchers, policy makers and practitioners. How has the reform progressed? How has it reshaped the incentives of firms? What are the difficulties faced?

The book has a unique set of chapters, by key people who have shaped the field which offer novel insights into these questions.\nThe book has been edited by key people who have worked on bankruptcy reform since 2010.
