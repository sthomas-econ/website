  abstract =     {Value-at-Risk (VaR) is widely used as a tool for
                  measuring the market risk of asset
                  portfolios. However, alternative VaR implementations
                  are known to yield fairly different VaR
                  forecasts. Hence, every use of VaR requires choosing
                  among alternative forecasting models. This paper
                  undertakes two case studies in model selection, for
                  the S&P 500 index and India's NSE-50 index, at the
                  95\% and 99\% levels. We employ a two-stage model
                  selection procedure. In the first stage we test a
                  class of models for statistical accuracy. If
                  multiple models survive rejection with the tests, we
                  perform a second stage filtering of the surviving
                  models using subjective loss functions. This
                  two-stage model selection procedure does prove to be
                  useful in choosing a VaR model, while only
                  incompletely addressing the problem. These case
                  studies give us some evidence about the strengths
                  and limitations of present knowledge on estimation
                  and testing for VaR.}
